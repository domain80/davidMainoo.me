## A Fresh Perspective

As we approach 2026, I find myself reflecting on the patterns and cycles we experience in our professional lives. There's a certain comfort in familiarity, but also a danger in complacency.

The tech industry moves fast. What was cutting-edge yesterday is legacy today. But some principles remain timeless: clean code, thoughtful architecture, and genuine problem-solving.

## Making It Better

It may not be different, but it can be better. That's my mantra for the coming year.

Better doesn't always mean bigger. Sometimes it means simpler. More focused. More intentional.

What will you make better in 2026?
